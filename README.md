# My Portfolio — Starter Project

This is a starter portfolio site with multiple pages, responsive layout, basic animations, and JavaScript interactions (theme toggle, mobile nav, card flip, and form validation).

## Structure
- `index.html`, `about.html`, `projects.html`, `contact.html`
- `css/styles.css` — layout, responsive styles, animations
- `js/main.js` — site interactions (theme, nav, validation)
- `images/` and `assets/` for media and downloads

## Run locally
Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the folder with a static server (recommended):
npx http-server
# or
python -m http.server 8000

## Deploy
### GitHub Pages
1. Create a repo and push the files.
2. In repository **Settings → Pages**, set the source to `main` branch and root (`/`).
3. Visit `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/` after a minute.

### Netlify / Vercel
- Drag and drop the folder or connect your Git repo for automatic deploys.

## Notes
- Replace placeholders like `[Your Name]` and project links.
- Add optimized images to the `images/` folder.
- Test on multiple screen sizes and validate HTML/CSS.
